=====================

WIP: part of a new way to deal with vim configs

The main idea is that usually plugins are pulled along with their updates, but
they require some tweaking to get them to work the way you want. You don't want
to create a copy and deal with the changes, so you want to maintain a git repo.

Vim scripts are available on GitHub, but they aren't updated by you so it is
hard to work with them the way you want. Well, more the way *I* want. :-P

This is also meant to help with managing importing the plugins into your master
Vim config.
